VectorShift is a no-code, drag-and-drop interface to build, design, prototype, and deploy generative AI workflows. Example use cases: 

* **Chatbots:** Build a fully functional chatbot and embed it into your website in minutes. Chatbot is able to respond to user queries and answer questions based on a knowledge base (e.g., product documentation, support articles)

* **Document Search:** Summarize and answer questions about documents, videos, audio files, and websites instantly.

* **Content Creation:** Create marketing copy, personalized outbound emails, call summaries, proposals, and graphics at scale and in a predetermined format and style.

* **Analyst:** Replicate the logical thinking of an analyst to generate synthesized output.

Our site is structured into the following tabs:

1. **Overview:** the landing page. Jump either to our pipeline builder or marketplace.

2. **Marketplace:** a library of pre-built pipelines. Contribute to the marketplace by sharing your pipelines with other users! Within the marketplace, you can search for pipelines and “import” them into your workspace.

3. **Pipelines:** where you can find pipelines you have built. The “build” button opens up the pipeline builder, our drag-and-drop tool to build generative AI workflows. Additionally, you can utilize the pull-down menu on the top right to find your “imported pipelines” from the marketplace. Once selected, you can select a pipeline and click “add to my pipeline” to add to your pipeline workspace.

4. **Files:** you can find your stored files. You can upload files here and utilize them later in the pipeline builder.

5. **Chatbots:** turn pipelines you have built into Chatbots. Test the Chatbots in our interface before deploying to your end users via API.

6. **Transformations:**

At its core, a pipeline will have the following components: 

1. **Input / Output Node:** Information (e.g., written text, video, audio, files) provided in the input node is used as an “input” to connecting nodes. The output node represents the result of the pipeline.

2. **Large Language Model (LLM):** an LLM is a trained deep-learning model that can generate output in a human-like fashion. You can connect other nodes (e.g., the input node) to the LLM to use as inputs into the model to instruct the model on what to do.

3. **Data Loaders:** nodes that allow you to import data into a pipeline. We currently offer the following data loaders: files, URL (data scraping), PDF, Wikipedia, YouTube video, and Arxiv.

4. **VectorDB:** vector databases are a type of database that stores unstructured data in vector embeddings (e.g., vector representation of the data) to facilitate retrieval (e.g., allow users to query to identify relevant data).
