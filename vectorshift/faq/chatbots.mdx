### I have deployed my Chatbot publicly. How does affect my credits?

Anytime someone runs your Chatbot, it will charge your account (i.e., the account that deployed it) the appropriate number of credits. You should keep this in mind if deploying Chatbots built upon expensive Pipelines.

### What happens if I run out of credits while running a deployed Chatbot?

The Chatbot will stop working until you replenish your credits.
