You can generate images using the Image Gen node by passing a prompt. 

![](/images/image.png)

Images generated by an Image Gen node can either be stored using a [File Save](/vectorshift/platform/pipelines/file#file-save-nodes) node or outputted to an [Output](/vectorshift/platform/pipelines/inputs-outputs) node with the type Image. Images outputted to Output nodes are not stored in run history, so they must be saved to files or downloaded immediately to be stored.
