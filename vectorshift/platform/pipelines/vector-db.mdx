title: "Vector DB"
description: "Vector Databases are a type of database often used in conjunction with LLMs. Vector databases store data from a source (e.g., file, website, youtube video), allow for a query, and returns the most relevant data from the source."

## VectorDB Loader

The VectorDB takes data from the data loader and stores it into a Vector database. The "documents" input connects with a data loader (e.g., file loader, URL loader, youtube video loader). 

## VectorDB Reader

The VectorDB reader connects with a VectorDB loader (through the "database" node) and a query (e.g., from a text block or input block) and returns relevant data based on the query through the "results" output. The "results" output is often connected to a text block that serves as a prompt for a LLM. 

## Vector Store Reader

The Vector Store reader links to an existing [Vector Store](/vectorshift/platform/storage/vector-stores) that you have defined, allowing you to query the Vector Store for information without having to upload new documents. Like the VectorDB Reader, the "results" output is often connected to a text block that serves as a prompt for a LLM.
