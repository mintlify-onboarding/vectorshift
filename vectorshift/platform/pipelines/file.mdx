## File Node

The File node allows you to select a file that has been uploaded under the "File" tab of the platform. You can connect this node as an input into other nodes.

### Usage

Since files are stored in their raw format, it can be useful to load them using a [File loader](/vectorshift/platform/pipelines/data-loaders) before inputting them to LLMs or other nodes.

## File Save Nodes

You can save files that were inputted or generated by your Pipeline using a File Save node. These nodes allow you to store files within your Files tab.

By default, these files will be stored as:

`"{{ Pipeline Name }} - {{ File Save Node ID }} - {{ Timestamp }}"`

where the values enclosed in curly brackets are replaced by the actual values. If you pass a value into the `"name"` input, the files will be stored as:

`"{{ Pipeline Name }} - {{ name }} - {{ Timestamp }}"`

If you pass multiple files of the same type into `"files"`, any files beyond the first will also have a number surrounded in parentheses to separate them.

_Passing the same name to multiple File Save nodes may cause some generated files to be overridden._
