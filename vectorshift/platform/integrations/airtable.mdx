Just like setting up a[ Notion integration](/vectorshift/platform/integrations/notion), you can integrate with Airtable by going to the Integrations tab, adding a new Integration, and selecting "Airtable" as the Integration type. Next, you will need to choose a table that you want to connect with Airtable.

To use your connected pages, go create a Pipeline and drag an "`Integration`" node, select the Airtable integration you made, and choose "Read Tables" for the function and choose the tables. The figure below is an example of how you can integrate Airtable with your pipeline.
