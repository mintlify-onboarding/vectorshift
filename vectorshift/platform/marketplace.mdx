The Marketplace is a repository of pre-built Pipelines. You can run these Pipelines directly from the Marketplace. If a Pipeline is Open Source, you can click "View" to see the nodes that make up the Pipeline. You can [import Pipelines](/vectorshift/platform/marketplace#import-a-pipeline), adding them to your Imported Pipelines list for easy access.

If you have a Pipeline that you'd like to share on the Marketplace, you can [publish your Pipeline](/vectorshift/platform/marketplace#publish-a-pipeline) from the Pipelines tab.

Each Pipeline in the Marketplace has a unique URL when opened, so you can send links with any Pipelines you publish or find useful to others.
