To view pipelines that you have imported from the marketplace, click "imported pipelines" from the pull down menu on the top right. 

To move a pipeline from "Imported Pipelines" to the "My Pipelines" page where they can be edited, click on the 3 dots on the right hand side of the pipeline and click "Add to My Pipelines"

From the pull down menu, you can also view pipelines that are shared with you if you are in an organization or historical runs of a pipeline you have previously run.


Delete a pipeline by checking a pipeline and clicking "Delete".
